    Imagine a university in the heart of a lively city center. An intimate campus nestled on the waterfront, steps from world-class cultural institutions. A faculty committed to learning and research on all levels and across disciplines. Students working in partnership with the community.

    Add custom styles to your page so it matches the usfsp.edu site in terms of colors and typography.
